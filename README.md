# @pixelscortex/convelt

A lightweight, feature-rich Convex client implementation for Svelte. Built because existing solutions don't update fast enough and lack essential features.

## Why This Exists

The official `convex-svelte` package updates slowly and missing key features. This implementation provides faster updates and enhanced functionality.

## Todo

- [ ] `createQuery` with client-side cache and conditional skip
- [ ] `createCursorPagination` with client-side cache and conditional skip
- [ ] `createMutation` implementation
- [ ] `createAction` implementation
- [ ] Better Auth + Convex integration for SvelteKit
- [ ] Composable UI helpers following shadcn/ui patterns
